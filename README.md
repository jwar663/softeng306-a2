TODO:

* Implement level select scene
* Implement simple HUD (health bar)
* Implement dialogue UI used for interacting with NPCs
* Implement start menu and game over/victory menus
* Improve story of first prototype level, in particular making the mechanics and objectives of the game obvious to the player, and adding some kind of loss condition

* Implement other menus and functionality e.g. settings, savefiles
* Implement more levels that are more complex

Notes/Troubleshooting:

Use Unity 2018.4.10f1 (LTS), if you don't it probably won't work.

You might have to select a scene in the project view to see what's going on when first importing the project.

To disable CRLF warnings in git: `git config --global core.safecrlf false`
