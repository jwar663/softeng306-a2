### Build Instructions:

Open the project using Unity 2018.4.10f1. Create a folder "Build" in the project directory. File > Build and Run the project, and select the Build directory. The executable will be located at Build/Rpg2DTopDown.exe.

A build has been provided with the [Prototype](https://github.com/veratrum/softeng306-a2/releases/tag/v0.1-prototype) release.

### TODO:

* Implement other menus and functionality e.g. settings, savefiles
* Implement more levels that are more complex
* ~Implement level select scene~
* ~Implement simple HUD (health bar)~
* ~Implement dialogue UI used for interacting with NPCs~
* ~Implement start menu and game over/victory menus~
* ~Improve story of first prototype level, in particular making the mechanics and objectives of the game obvious to the player, and adding some kind of loss condition~

### Notes/Troubleshooting:

Use Unity 2018.4.10f1 (LTS), if you don't it probably won't work.

You might have to select a scene in the project view to see what's going on when first importing the project.

To disable CRLF warnings in git: `git config --global core.safecrlf false`

Parts of this project won't work properly unless you run it starting from the menu scene.
