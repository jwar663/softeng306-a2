### Build Instructions:

Open the project using Unity 2018.4.10f1. Create a folder "Build" in the project directory. File > Build and Run the project, and select the Build directory. The executable will be located at Build/Rpg2DTopDown.exe.

A build has been provided with the [Prototype](https://github.com/veratrum/softeng306-a2/releases/tag/v0.1-prototype) release.

### Notes/Troubleshooting:

Use Unity 2018.4.10f1 (LTS), if you don't it probably won't work.

You might have to select a scene in the project view to see what's going on when first importing the project.

To disable CRLF warnings in git: `git config --global core.safecrlf false`

If the release build doesn't work try restarting the editor and building it again.

Parts of this project won't work properly unless you run it starting from the menu scene.
